      <description>The Problem The upgrade from our university&amp;rsquo;s websub system to gradescope looks and feels great for sure, but the approach of having to upload your files each time or maintaining a separate GitHub repo for each assignment is a pain. The whole process gets even worse when you have to deal with folders within your assignment.
Solution! We have developed a tiny python script that will upload all the files in the folder placed in as a submission to gradescope.</description>
